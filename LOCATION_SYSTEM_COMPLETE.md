# Location & Time System - Implementation Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully implemented a professional location and time system with context, modal, saved neighborhoods, and geolocation support.

## Files Created

### 1. Core Infrastructure
- **`lib/storage.ts`** - LocalStorage wrapper for persisted preferences
- **`context/LocationContext.tsx`** - Context provider for location and time window state

### 2. Location Components
- **`components/location/LocationButton.tsx`** - Header pill button showing neighborhood and time
- **`components/location/LocationModal.tsx`** - Modal with tabs (Nearby/Saved/Search)

### 3. Updated Files
- **`app/page.tsx`** - Integrated location components and context
- **`app/layout.tsx`** - Wrapped app with LocationProvider

## Features Implemented

### Location System
✅ Context provider with persisted state
✅ Saved neighborhoods in localStorage
✅ Geolocation support with error handling
✅ Manual search with autocomplete (mock)
✅ Modal with tabbed interface (Nearby/Saved/Search)

### Time Window System
✅ Time window selection (Now, Later today, etc.)
✅ Persisted to localStorage
✅ Integrated into LocationButton display

### UI Integration
✅ LocationButton replaces hardcoded location display
✅ LocationModal opens on edit button click
✅ Sticky bar shows current location
✅ Uses location from context throughout

## How It Works

### Context Provider
- Manages location state (lat, lng, label, neighborhood)
- Manages time window state
- Manages saved neighborhoods array
- Persists all state to localStorage
- Provides setter functions for updating state

### LocationButton
- Displays current neighborhood and time window
- Opens LocationModal on click
- Shows loading states

### LocationModal
- **Nearby Tab**: "Use my location" button with geolocation
- **Saved Tab**: List of saved neighborhoods
- **Search Tab**: Manual search with autocomplete
- **Time Window Section**: Selection of time options
- Smooth animations with Framer Motion

## Usage

The system is now integrated into the home page:

1. User sees their current location in the header
2. Clicking "Edit" opens the LocationModal
3. User can:
   - Use geolocation (requires permission)
   - Select from saved neighborhoods
   - Search manually
   - Change time window
4. Selection is saved to localStorage and persists

## Next Steps

The location system is now complete! To finish the full requirements:

- **STEP 2-5**: Still need to implement unified search slab, spacing refinements, motion enhancements, explore hook-up, and QA polish

## Files Summary

**Created:**
- `lib/storage.ts`
- `context/LocationContext.tsx`
- `components/location/LocationButton.tsx`
- `components/location/LocationModal.tsx`

**Modified:**
- `app/page.tsx` - Added location integration
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added LocationProvider wrapper

✅ **Location system is complete and ready to use!**
