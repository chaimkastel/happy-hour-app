- ✅ API endpoints for deals, favorites, wallet, etc.

## Required Transformation
The user wants a complete consumer-first UX transformation following the spec in the prompt. This involves:

### 1. **Home Page Redesign** (Priority 1)
- Simplify hero section
- Add sections: "Happening Now", "Tonight's Happy Hours", "Because You Liked", "New This Week"
- Clear top bar with location/time
- Search: "What do you feel like eating?"

### 2. **Explore Page** (Priority 2)
- Enhanced filters (Now/Later, price tiers, diet preferences)
- Better sort (Best Value, Closest, Ending Soon)
- Map/List toggle
- Distance and rating on cards

### 3. **Deal Detail** (Priority 3)
- Image slider

### 7. **UI/UX Polish** (Priority 7)
- Orange primary color (#f97316)
- Large, legible typography
- Rounded cards, soft shadows
- Subtle animations
- Human, friendly copywriting

## Approach
Given the large scope, I'll need to:
1. Transform pages one at a time
2. Start with Home, Explore, Deal Detail (core user journey)
3. Then Wallet, Account, and polish
4. Ensure consistency across all pages

## Key Files to Transform
- `app/page.tsx` - Home page
- `app/explore/page.tsx` - Explore page  
- `app/deal/[id]/view/page.tsx` - Deal detail
- `app/wallet/page.tsx` - Wallet
- `app/account/page.tsx` - Account
- `components/navigation/BottomNav.tsx` - Navigation
- All copy/strings throughout

## Notes
- Must maintain functional API integration
- Keep existing components where possible
- Focus on UX improvements, not breaking changes
- Deploy frequently to test
