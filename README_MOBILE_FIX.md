# Mobile Page Fix

## Issue Fixed
The `/mobile` page was showing a blank area at desktop viewport widths due to the `MobileShell` component having `md:hidden` class, which hides mobile UI at desktop breakpoints (768px+).

## Root Cause
- `components/mobile/MobileShell.tsx` line 29: `md:hidden` class was hiding the entire mobile shell at desktop viewport widths
- The loading state would render, but when `isLoaded` became `true`, the `MobileShell` was hidden by Tailwind's responsive classes

## Solution
1. **Added `forceMobile` prop to `MobileShell`**: When `true`, disables the `md:hidden` class and always shows mobile UI regardless of viewport
2. **Updated `/mobile` page**: Uses `forceMobile={true}` to ensure mobile UI is always visible
3. **Removed problematic loading state**: Eliminated the `isLoaded` state that was causing the blank page

## Files Changed
- `components/mobile/MobileShell.tsx`: Added `forceMobile` prop and conditional class logic
- `app/mobile/page.tsx`: Added `forceMobile={true}` and removed loading state logic

## Verification
- `/mobile` now renders mobile UI at all viewport sizes (desktop and mobile)
- `/` continues to render responsive desktop/mobile UI based on breakpoints
- No console errors or hydration warnings
- All mobile interactions work correctly

## Test Coverage
A Playwright test was created at `__tests__/mobile-page.spec.ts` to prevent regression:
- Verifies `/mobile` renders at desktop viewport (1200x800)
- Verifies `/mobile` renders at mobile viewport (375x667)  
- Verifies `/` desktop homepage is not affected

## Usage
- `/mobile` - Always shows mobile UI regardless of viewport
- `/` - Responsive behavior based on Tailwind breakpoints
- `MobileShell` with `forceMobile={true}` - Forces mobile UI at all viewport sizes
- `MobileShell` with `forceMobile={false}` (default) - Responsive behavior with `md:hidden`
