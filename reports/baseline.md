# Phase 0 - Baseline Health Report

## Build Status
✅ **Build**: Successful compilation
✅ **TypeScript**: No type errors
✅ **ESLint**: No linting errors

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Page Rendering Failures (P0)
- `/login` - Deopted into client-side rendering, shows `__next_error__` HTML
- `/explore` - Deopted into client-side rendering, shows `__next_error__` HTML  
- `/claim-success` - Deopted into client-side rendering

**Root Cause**: Pages are trying to access dynamic features (NextAuth, useSearchParams) during static generation, causing hydration mismatches.

### 2. Configuration Issues
- Sentry configuration warnings (server/edge configs need to be moved to instrumentation)
- Custom webpack configuration detected
- Missing ESLint configuration (just initialized)

## Route Analysis

### Public Routes (No Auth Required)
- `/` - Homepage ✅ Working
- `/about`, `/contact`, `/faq`, `/how-it-works` ✅ Working
- `/terms`, `/privacy`, `/cookies`, `/refund-policy` ✅ Working
- `/signup` ✅ Working
- `/pricing`, `/partner` ✅ Working

### Protected Routes (Auth Required)
- `/wallet` - Shows fake data to guests ❌ **CRITICAL**
- `/favorites` - Shows fake data to guests ❌ **CRITICAL**
- `/account/*` - Auth required ✅
- `/merchant/*` - Auth required ✅
- `/admin/*` - Auth required ✅

### Auth Routes
- `/login` - **BROKEN** - Shows `__next_error__` HTML ❌ **CRITICAL**
- `/explore` - **BROKEN** - Shows `__next_error__` HTML ❌ **CRITICAL**

## Notable TODOs & Issues

### Authentication Issues
1. **Phone validation blocking sign-up** - Phone field is required but validation is too strict
2. **Wallet accessible to guests** - Shows fake balances without login
3. **Merchant signup loops** - "Join as merchant" redirects to same login page
4. **No soft redirects** - Protected routes don't redirect with `next` parameter

### Data Issues
1. **Explore shows 0 deals** - API not properly wired to show real data
2. **Claim buttons inert** - No functionality implemented
3. **Fake data shown to guests** - Wallet, stats, etc. show placeholder data

### Technical Debt
1. **Sentry configuration** - Needs to be moved to instrumentation files
2. **Webpack configuration** - Custom config detected, may need optimization
3. **Missing error boundaries** - No proper error handling for failed pages

## Immediate Action Required

### P0 - Fix Login Page
The login page showing `__next_error__` HTML is blocking all authentication flows. This must be fixed before any other progress can be made.

**Hypothesis**: The issue is caused by NextAuth SessionProvider hydration mismatch or useSearchParams being called during static generation.

### P0 - Fix Explore Page  
The explore page showing `__next_error__` HTML is blocking deal discovery. This must be fixed to enable the core user journey.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix login page rendering** - Resolve hydration issues
2. **Fix explore page rendering** - Resolve hydration issues  
3. **Implement route protection** - Add middleware for auth-gated routes
4. **Remove fake data** - Ensure no demo data shown to guests
5. **Wire up deal APIs** - Connect explore to real data

## Route Protection Status

```typescript
// Current middleware.ts analysis needed
// Expected protected routes:
- /wallet
- /favorites  
- /account/*
- /merchant/*
- /admin/*

// Expected public routes:
- /login
- /signup
- /explore (should show deals or empty state)
- All marketing pages
```

## Database Schema Status
