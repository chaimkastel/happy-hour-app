- Build errors due to missing environment variables

## ⚠️ Current Issue: Missing Environment Variables

The deployment is failing because **Vercel needs environment variables configured**.

## 🚀 Complete the Deployment (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Configure Environment Variables in Vercel

1. Go to **[Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)**
2. Select your project: **happy-hour-app**
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Add these required variables:

#### **Critical - Required for Build:**

```bash
# Generate this with: openssl rand -base64 32
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-generated-secret-here

# Your Vercel URL (will be shown after first deployment)
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://happy-hour-app.vercel.app

# Database - Option A: Use Vercel's Neon Integration
# Go to Storage tab → Add Neon → DATABASE_URL auto-added

# Database - Option B: Use Existing Neon Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@ep-xxx.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
```

#### **Optional (Recommended):**

```bash
# For rate limiting
REDIS_URL=redis://default:xxx@regional.upstash.io:6379

# For error tracking (already configured in code)
SENTRY_DSN=https://xxx@sentry.io/xxx
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your_sentry_token

# For payments (if using)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxx
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_xxx
```

### Step 2: Redeploy

After adding environment variables:

**Option A: Automatic (Recommended)**
- Vercel will auto-redeploy from GitHub  
- Just wait ~3 minutes

**Option B: Manual Trigger**
- In Vercel Dashboard → Deployments
- Click **"Redeploy"** on the latest deployment

**Option C: Force Redeploy via CLI**
```bash
vercel --prod --yes --force
```

### Step 3: Run Database Migrations

Once deployed successfully, initialize the database:

```bash
# Pull environment variables from Vercel
vercel env pull .env.production.local

# Run migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Seed with demo data (optional)
npm run db:seed:demo
```

## 📊 Verify Deployment

Test these endpoints once deployed:

- **Home Page:** `https://your-app.vercel.app`
- **Health Check:** `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health`  
- **Explore Page:** `https://your-app.vercel.app/explore`
- **API Test:** `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/deals/search`

## 🎯 What Will Work Immediately

Once environment variables are set, these features work out of the box:

### Without Database:
- ✅ Home page (UI only)
- ✅ Static pages (About, How It Works, FAQ, Legal pages)
- ✅ Partner/merchant info pages
- ⚠️ Auth/deals will need database

### With Database Connected:
- ✅ Full authentication (signup, login, logout)
- ✅ Deal exploration with search and filters
- ✅ Favorites and wallet management
- ✅ Merchant portal and dashboard
- ✅ Complete user journey

## 🔧 Quick Troubleshooting

### Build Still Failing?

**Check in Vercel Dashboard → Deployment Logs:**

1. **Missing NEXTAUTH_SECRET:**
   ```bash
   # Generate and add to Vercel:
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

2. **Missing DATABASE_URL:**
   - Add Neon integration in Vercel Storage tab
   - Or add manual connection string

3. **Schema Mismatch:**
   - The code now uses correct field names (`startAt`/`endAt`)
   - Run `prisma migrate deploy` after first successful deployment

### Database Connection Error?

```bash
# Verify in Vercel:
1. Storage → Neon → Check status
2. Environment Variables → Verify DATABASE_URL format:
   postgresql://user:pass@host/db?sslmode=require
```

### Auth Not Working?

```bash
# Ensure these match:
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<32+ character random string>
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-exact-domain.vercel.app
```
